* POLICE SHOOTING IN THE UNITED STATE OF AMERICA

** Introduction

Matthew Hoffman, a 32 years old white man was fatally shot on Sunday, 4th of January 2015 at approximately 5:20 p.m. Hoffman was described to have entered the restricted area of the Mission Station parking lot where three police sergeants were on their way to get coffee. At first he appeared to comply when the sergeants told Hoffman to exit the lot. While officers got into their patrol car, Hoffman remained in the same spot for some time. Concerned, the officer got out of their vehicle, told Hoffman to exit, at which point he backed away towards Valencia Street with his hands in his pockets, “staring at the officers.”

When Hoffman lifted up his sweatshirt to display what was later revealed to be an airsoft pistol—with legally mandated orange markings blacked out—and pointed it at the officers, two of them fired five rounds each at Hoffman. Three bullets landed in his forearm, leg, and upper body. He died from his wounds later that night at San Francisco General Hospital.

The case of Mathew Hoffman is just one of thousands of police shooting incidents that happens yearly. This cases is worth looking into to understand the cause and possible solutions.
